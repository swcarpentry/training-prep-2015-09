I apologies to two counts:
It has taken me too long to produce this outline of an exercise and there is not enough detail.
The reasons are it has been very busy, at work on Dec 25th, and I don't quite know what you want and that giving me a mental block
If you had a model of the detail you are looking for I have experience teaching this stuff and can flesh out an outline like this quite quickly.
