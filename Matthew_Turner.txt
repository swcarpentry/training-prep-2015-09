As a research software developer at the Northwest Knowledge Network at the University of Idaho,
I develop full-stack web applications, REST and Python APIs, and server-side programming to support 
data management and hydrological modeling. I have used IPython for almost a decade, 
script and pipe commands in the shell when appropriate, and I follow software development best practices 
(test-driven development, orthogonal designs) always. Like a carpenter I take great pride not only in the 
outward, obvious functionality of the code I write, but also in the structure and presentation of
the code itself.
